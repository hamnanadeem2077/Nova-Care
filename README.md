# Nova-Care
I designed this health dashboard in Figma, focusing on a clean and user-friendly interface. To further refine my skills, I took it a step further and coded the design using HTML and CSS in VS Code. This project was a great exercise in bridging design and development, ensuring both aesthetics and functionality work seamlessly together.
